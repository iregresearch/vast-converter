# COMMUNICATION BETWEEN FREELANCER AND TEAM

# GULREZ:

I have created each step. I want to start by building the form-Builder, then move on to the contact form and subscription forms.
I have added a comment section for each part. When adding comments, I suggest opening the reference website as well
so that we can develop a better website.

# AHMAD MALIK

Dear Gulrez,

For the website similar to elfsight.com that has the registration, login / logout, user credentials, roles, authorizations, teams, blogs and much more..... We are going to use Django CMS.

It is already installed on Google cloud hosting.

Let us know what you think and feel free to suggest anything that you feel appropriate.

# GULREZ:

Could you please provide the url of the website

# AHMAD MALIK

Apart from the Django CMS for the front end,

For the server side / backend API calls Django DRF will be used.
What do you think of using HTMX and react.js in combination with Django CMS?

Or is there a better way?
Django CMS is simply installed. Just like the default standard install.

During the development you can do the work on the local host....

Because our team is also new and learning.... So let us know what you think is appropriate?

# GULREZ:

I wanted to preview the website's color combination to incorporate it into the form development.

Using Django REST Framework (DRF) for the API is fine

For the form I would like to use htmx
Generally, we keep reusable code in separate folders or a main folder to eliminate code redundancy.

This is the good way for maintaining clean and efficient code. Having a main style and JavaScript file can help ensure consistency and reusability across the website.
Please let me know your opinion

# AHMAD MALIK:

HTMX = Yes. Go ahead.
Yes. Makes sense.
As part of this project you only do HTMX.

However:
We will like to play with both:
HTMX as well as react.js

In other words, our website will allow the users to download two types of widgets: one with HTMX and second with React.

So please keep this in mind.

# GULREZ

Great I'll proceed with HTMX

# AHMAD MALIK

Both HTMX and React widgets will be using the same database....

Now for mobile... We have iconic in React. How about HTMX?

# GULREZ:

Ionic is more suited for building mobile applications
and
HTMX is specifically designed for creating interactive web applications,

while developing the widget i will ensure that the widget is self-contained and can function independently.

# AHMAD MALIK:

So do you mean to say: HTMX will also function on mobile?
Or how will mobile work on HTMX?

# GULREZ:

Yes, it works and will be effective. I plan to integrate html with JavaScript.
